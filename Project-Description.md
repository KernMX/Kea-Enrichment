## Description
        Kea Enrichment is a project focusing on the enrichment of the lives of Kea kept in captivity at 
        the cincinnati zoo.
## Problem Statement
        The kea is a species of very smart birds at the Cincinnati Zoo. These birds are
        very curious but can also be destructive in their curiosity. They will usually pry apart and
        attempt to understand toys given to them. For this reason, kea need to have toys that
        are both engaging and durable to withstand the keaâ€™s tinkering. The kea is an interesting
        species of bird and the zookeepers and staff of the zoo wish to be able to demonstrate
        this to zoo visitors.
## Current Shortcomings
        There currently do not exist any enrichment devices for Kea
## Group Skils and Interests
* Game Development
* AI Programming
* Embedded Systems
* Curcuit Development
## Approach and Goals
        In order to mentally stimulate the kea in a constructive way, as well as to further
        engage the zoo visitors, a new exhibit will be created that can allow the kea to play a
        game with zoo visitors. This exhibit will have an element that the zoo visitor can interact
        with and an element the kea can interact with. The game will start simply and increase
        in complexity over time. The game will give a reward to the kea for winning. These games will
        be both mechanical and software in nature.
Our group has the following goals:
* A game engine that can connect Kea and zoo guests in simple games such as tic-tac-toe, etc...
* A way of rewarding the Kea for participating in games
* A way to have dynamic difficulty to keep Kea engaged
* Cooperative play
