## Description
        Autonomous Lawn Mower is a smart self driving lawn mower capable of handling complex lawns without secondary systems.
        Autonomous
## Problem Statement
        Current implementations of autonoumous lawn mowing systems are inadequate in the way they mow lawns. 
## Current Shortcomings
        Current implementations of autonoumous lawn mowing systems require the use of secondary hardware such as a guiding wire.
        This leads to added costs and an inherit limit to the size and scope of how much distance the unit can cover out of the box.
        Current implementations are also limited by the fact that they follow a random walk path, meaning that current systems mow
        in straight lines until they come into contact with an object such as a rock or childs toy at which point they will turn
        and continue mowing. This leads to inelegant mowing and asthetically displeasing mow lines.
## Group Skils and Interests
* Autonomous AI programming
* Robotics programming and assembly
## Approach and Goals
        Our group plans to implement an autonomous lawn mower that will use imaging of a yard along with gps positioning to
        navigate and mow a lawn in an elegant and asthetically pleasing manner.
Our group has the following goals:
* Web or mobile application to interact with the lawn mower and feed it instructions (satellite or map images), style of
  cut (mow lines pattern)
* A physical prototype of the lawn mower
* A demo video showcasing the full extent of the AI andmowing process
